# Youtube for Kids

This small webapp was built for my own personal use. I am frustrated at the amount of click baits and crap content on Youtube which makes me want to block youtube from my home network all together, but at the same, I see immense potential and "good" content on the platform as well which could be very enriching to my kids. As adults, we can make a call as to what content to watch, which to laugh about and what to ignore, but as kids, thats often unsupervised and they really get the wrong ideas.

## The idea of a filtered youtube

The idea was to allow kids to search through youtube for any content they'd like to see. e.g. "how to solve a rubiks cube" and then send that video for an approval to their parents.

Once approved, this content automatically downloads to a folder on the server. I have personally linked that folder to my plex media server and my kids can then watch that video via plex.
